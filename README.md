# DSS Web Scraping Sentiment Analysis
 In this project, we are designing a sentiment analysis tool to identify bias in text, especially in political contexts. Using this tool, we will also design a web scraping function in which users can input a term and our tool could scrape the Internet to get a temperature of how the web is feeling about the corresponding topic.
